        <h1> About the Author </h1>
        <p> I took a trip across Europe and the U.K. for 28 days back in the pre-pandemic days. As soon as my final exams in university were over, I packed up a backpack with 4 shirts and 2 pairs of pants and headed on my way. I was freshly 18 and surrounded in my tour group by partying Australians, New Zealanders, and the select few Canadians. While they were hungover and asleep on the coach bus, I took in every sight I could. I would be remiss not to show you my absolute favourites, the sights I still think about to this day. So I have selected 4 standouts that must be on your bucket list for a European vacation.</p>

        <h2> The Cathedral of Barcelona, Spain </h2>
        <img src="barcelonacathedral.jpg" alt="A photo of the Barcelona Cathedral with a blue sky appearing above.">
        <p> This awe-inspiring cathedral is located on the Pla de la Seu in Catalonia, Spain. Fuelled by a previous night of wandering Barcelona with a bottle of Sangria in hand, facing this cathedral in the morning was almost... a spiritual experience. I am not a religious person by any means; but I would be lying if I did not say that I wanted to get married in this cathedral. </p>
        <p> This cathedral was finished in the 14th century and includes many elements of Gothic Revival. Which, in layman's terms, refers to all kinds of decorative elements like the arches, the masonry, and gargoyles. </p>

        <h2> The Cote d'Azur </h2>
        <img src="nice.JPG" alt="A coastal view of bright blue waters and a bright blue sky located in Nice, France.">
        <p> Travelling to Nice was the little break of the month-long trip in which most of the tour group were sleeping in the hostel. I took a short walk, likely 10 minutes, from my hostel to this gorgeous coastal view. This beach was covered in slate grey stones, so meandering down to the water was difficult. But once there, with the sounds of the gentle waves in the background, one can truly feel peace. It makes me want to live out a dream I have never had about living right on the coast and opening the door to beautiful blue waves. </p>
        <p> Just a short walk from the coast is a small mountain hike where you can see the entire city.</p>
