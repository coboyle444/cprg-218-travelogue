        <h1> About the Author </h1>
        <p> I took a trip across Europe and the U.K. for 28 days back in the pre-pandemic days. As soon as my final exams in university were over, I packed up a backpack with 4 shirts and 2 pairs of pants and headed on my way. I was freshly 18 and surrounded in my tour group by partying Australians, New Zealanders, and the select few Canadians. While they were hungover and asleep on the coach bus, I took in every sight I could. I would be remiss not to show you my absolute favourites, the sights I still think about to this day. So I have selected 4 standouts that must be on your bucket list for a European vacation.</p>
